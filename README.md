LiMCA is a new single-cell sequencing method that can simultaneously profile the 3D genome structure and transcriptome in individual cells. On transcriptome side, LiMCA provides full-length mRNA read coverage for thousands of genes. This capacity is crucial for research across various domains, such as olfactory receptor expression. On 3D genome side, LiMCA can accurately identify distinct cell types and reconstruct high-resolution 3D models.


This repository contains data, scripts, pipelines used for LiMCA analysis.
